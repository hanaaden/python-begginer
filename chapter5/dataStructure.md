there is a methods in list 
- appends : add an item to the end 
- extend : extend list by appending all items

items that include integer and string cant be sorted cuz integer 
cant be compered to string 

**stack**
 last element added is first element retreived (lastin first out)
to add item to top of stack use append

you can use list as queue where first element added is first element 
retrieved
