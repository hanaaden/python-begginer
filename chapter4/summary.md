pythons for statement iterates over the items of any sequence

## the range() function
if you need a iteration of sequence number the build in function 
range() comes in handy 
for varibale in range(number)

In many ways the object returned by range() behaves as if it is a list, but in fact it isn’t. It is an object which returns the successive items of the desired sequence when you iterate over it, but it doesn’t really make the list, thus saving space.
