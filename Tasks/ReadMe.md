## 1: Explain how Python's interpreted nature benefits rapid application development.

strengths to accelerate software development, emphasizing speed, flexibility, and user involvement.
Key aspects of RAD in Python:
Simplicity and Readability:
Python's concise and readable syntax allows developers to write less code, reducing development time and improving collaboration.
Rich Ecosystem:
Python boasts a vast collection of libraries and frameworks, such as Django 

Agile Alignment:
Python's flexibility and ease of iteration align well with agile development principles,
Cross-Platform Compatibility:
Python applications can be developed to run on various operating systems


## 2: Python supports high-level data types like lists and dictionaries. Why are these considered more flexible than data structures in low-level languages like C?

1. Dynamic Sizing:
Python:
Lists and dictionaries are dynamically sized.

C:
Arrays in C have a fixed size determined at compile time. 

Python:
Lists and dictionaries can store elements of different data types within the same collection. 

C:
C arrays are typically homogeneous, meaning they can only store elements of a single, specified data type.


## 3: Research and write a Python script that prints the current date and time using a built-in module 

## 4: Imagine you are renaming thousands of photo files. Write pseudocode for how Python could help automate this.

By leveraging the os.rename() function within a loop, you can systematically rename a large number of files based on various criteria, such as sequential numbering or incorporating metadata from the image file

## 5: What is the difference between running a script using python script.py and running Python in interactive mode?

### In script 
a python program can be written in a file. This file can then be saved and executed using the command prompt.
Script mode is very suitable for writing long pieces of code.

### Interactive mode 
is based on this ideology only. In the interactive mode as we enter a command and press enter, the very next step we get the output.
Means we use the command line
## What happens to sys.argv when you run a script using the -c and -m options?

## 6: Write a script that prints the name of the script and any command-line arguments passed to it. 

## 7: Try running a Python one-liner using python -c to print numbers from 1 to 5 using a loop.

## 8: How does Python handle type conversion between integers and floating point numbers in expressions?

## 9: What is the significance of the underscore variable _ in interactive mode?

## 10: Write a program that takes a user input string and counts how many vowels it contains.
   you will find the code in counter.py

## Create a list of numbers, then, square each number, keep only the ones greater than 50, print the result.
   you will find the code in lister.py

## What is the purpose of the else clause in a loop, and how does it behave differently from the if statement’s else?


## Describe a scenario where continue would be more useful than break in a loop.


## Simulate a simple login system: Give the user 3 chances to enter the correct password, use a while loop and break to stop early if the password is correct, print “Access Denied” if all attempts are used.
 you will find the code in password.py
