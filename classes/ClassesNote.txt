scope refers a region  of program where variable is accesibl
python to determine the variable uses this rule LEGB ~ local , enclosing , global , build-in
= the variable that is defined inside the function is only accesible inside withun that function 
   called local variable 
=this scope is observed when you ave nested function called enclosing 
= variable defined at the top of script or module are called global scope
   means variable is accesible any function
= variable that is defined like preassigned in python functions like print() and len() 
  is called biuld-in scope

  z.real
z is object real is an attribite of object z
namespace is system that ensures unique name like variable function and other things  

class object support 2 kinds of operations :
- attribite reference 
- instantiation

MYclass.i = are valid attribute reference 
x= MYclass() = class instantiation uses function notation just pretend
the class object is perameters functions that return new instatn 
x=MYclass() = creates new instance of class and assigns this object 
to local variable x
