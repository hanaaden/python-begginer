If you often work on computers, you’ll eventually find tasks you’d like to automate—such as editing many text files, organizing photos, or writing custom applications. While shell scripts or batch files can handle basic tasks, they aren’t suited for more complex programs like games or GUIs. C/C++/Java can be powerful but slow and tedious to develop with.

Python is a better choice: it's easy to learn and use, works across major operating systems, and speeds up development. It’s a real programming language—more structured than shell scripts, with better error checking than C, and more powerful built-in data types like lists and dictionaries.

Python supports modular programming, includes a wide array of standard libraries (file I/O, sockets, GUIs, etc.), and runs without compilation. Its interactive mode encourages experimentation and quick testing. Python code is also concise and readable thanks to features like indentation-based blocks and no need for declarations.

Python is extensible, allowing C functions or modules to be integrated for speed or special library access. You can even embed Python in other applications as a scripting language.

Named after Monty Python’s Flying Circus, the language embraces humor and creativity. The tutorial encourages hands-on learning through examples, beginning with basics and progressing to advanced topics like exceptions and classes.
